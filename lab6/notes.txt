making elipsoid to cover the errors
constant vs variable errors
absolute constant error - average distance from target
constant error - systematic shift from target to center of cloud
variable error - estimate consistency using standard deviations of x, y, and z, then find sqrt of sum of squares
principle component analysis
elipsoid defined by center, lengths of each axis, and number of triangles
