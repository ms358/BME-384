skipping synchronization part
using dynamometer, emg, and cameras to measure grasping
will see how fingers open and close during reaching
how emg is related to force.
use emg script
aperture is distance between fingertips
investigate using google images which muscles are used to squeeze fingers together
flexor muscles in the hand
analyze kinematics and emg data separately
beginning and end of squeeze threshold for it is 10% of peak value
find area under curve using integral


# STUFF TO DO
filter magnitudes
average values for arrays
stem plot for the thingy thing
